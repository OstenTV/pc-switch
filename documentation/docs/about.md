Sort history of PokyPow.

## Why

A friend of mine asked me, if there is a product that he can use to power on,off and check PC state with Home Assistant.
His PC was in a hard to reach place in some cupboard and that is what he needed a solution for.
He also did not want to use some Chinese Cloud app.

Turns out there was no solution fitting his requirements.
So I started to figure out to build that solution.

## The name

First the project was called pc-switch.
Yeah, try to google that.
Not possible.
So CrowdSupply suggested to come up with a better name.

After a lot of brainstorming with my girlfriend, friends and ChatGPT I found PokyPow.
**Pok**e it in and **pow**er your PC.

Is it the best name?
Maybe not.
But at least you find relevant pages now, when you search for it.

## History

I build one with a ESP8266 dev board and it worked great.
But the WiFi was not good enough for myself with the PCB antennas.
I bought a board that has a connector for a external antenna.
Problem:
All these boards need to be soldered in order switch from PCB antenna to external antenna.
After trying again and again I sneezed and lost that teeny tiny 0 Ohm resistor and I stopped the project.
It was just not fun anymore.

However, people kept asking me about the project which I documented on my [blog](https://www.ajfriesen.com/tag/pokypow/).
I send a couple of them out but I was not in the mood to start the project.

After a while I checked how many people signed up because of the PokyPow (back then pc-switch, which is not possible to google!).
Turn out, over 100 people did sign up just for that at the time.

So I decided I will pay a freelancer to do the work I am bad at and do not like anyway: PCB design.
It took a couple of iterations, but I applied for a crowd funding campaign at [CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/ajfriesen/pokypow) and to my surprise they accepted my project!

Now I am talking to manufacturers to check pricing.
