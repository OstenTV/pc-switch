# BIOS/UEFI and USB always on

In order to use the PokyPow with the motherboard header, you have to activate a USB always on feature.
Unfortunately, this is not called the same.

On my MSI MAG B550M MORTAR WIFI it was called: **Resume By USB Device**

## No USB2.0 motherboard header or USB always on does not work?

You can still use the PokyPow.
Use a external power supply and power via the USB-C port.
